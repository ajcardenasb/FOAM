# FOAM: Functional Ontology Assignments for Metagenomes, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) database with environmental focus

In this repersitory you'll find script to rum the HMM databas that I developped with @bioman in this paper: 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4231724/

The database itself is big: 7G and can be downloaded here: http://cbb.pnnl.gov/portal/software/FOAM.html

Along with the Ontology and the alignements (if you want to go dig into that). 

Otherwise, you'll just to dowbalod the db, and oyu can sue one of the script here to run your annotation. Have fun! Let me know if you have question.
